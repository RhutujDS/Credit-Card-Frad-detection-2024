ðŸ’³ Unleashing the Potential of Hybrid Models for Augmented Credit Card Security

Developed and compared multiple machine learning models â€” Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost â€” for detecting credit card fraud using advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and SHAP-based interpretability.
XGBoost achieved the best results with 85% accuracy, F1 = 0.80, and ROC AUC = 0.90, outperforming all other models in handling imbalanced data.
The project highlights the importance of explainable AI and ensemble learning in building reliable, scalable fraud detection systems.
Tools: Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Pandas, Matplotlib.
